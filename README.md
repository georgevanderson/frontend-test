# Frontend Interview

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/georgevanderson/frontend-test.git
cd frontend-test
yarn install
yarn dev
# app is served at http://localhost:3000
```

## Instructions

> All code should be written in /app/js/script.js. Useful to reference index.html

1. Render a "table"  with the object keys as the header row

2. render data as "rows" under the table

3. When clicking on a header row for `age` or `friends`, sort the data high to low by value


Aim to make it so that header columns/sorting works for arbitrary property names (If we were to change `age` to `grade`)
